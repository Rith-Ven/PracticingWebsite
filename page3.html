        <p>King penguins mainly eat lanternfish, squid, and krill. On foraging trips, king penguins repeatedly dive to over 100 metres (300 ft), and have been recorded at depths greater than 300 metres (1,000 ft).</p>

            <p>Predators of the king penguin include giant petrels, skuas, the snowy sheathbill, the leopard seal, and the orca.</p> <!--3 is a descendant-->

        <p>The king penguin breeds on the subantarctic islands at the northern reaches of Antarctica, South Georgia, southern Argentina, and other temperate islands of the region.</p> <!--4 and 5 are siblings-->
        <p>This bird was exploited commercially in the past for its blubber, oil, meat, and feathers. Today it is fully protected.</p>
