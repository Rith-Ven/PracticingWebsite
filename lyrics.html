Babe, give me up before, then you don't wanna talk about it
Wait, now do I want you more, girl oh my god
Wrongfully hesitating I swear I would never wait
It's just hard for me everyday when I don't know your
Thoughts cause you never told me while she was my one and only

I want it all
I want ohh

I wanna try, but I don't know what I could ever say
When you won't even go to mine, but If you called me up I'd stay
For you

No I don't wanna be the guy to give her everything she likes
Until he's blue

But if you go and try it I might have to cross the line and say
Babe, give me up before, then you don't wanna talk about it
Wait, now do I want you more, girl oh my god

Wrongfully hesitating I swear I would never wait
It's just hard for me everyday when I don't know your
Thoughts cause you never told me while she was my one and only

I want it all
I want ohh

Wrongfully hesitating I swear I would never wait
It's just hard for me everyday when I don't know your
Thoughts cause you never told me while she was my one and only

I want it all
I want it all
